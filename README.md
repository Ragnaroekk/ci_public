This project was built to meet specifications per my software engieneering class. It demonstates a contrived example of time conversion. It uses a Continuous Integration workflow and automatic testing. This repositiry was spliced from the original so some of my work could be demonstrated. I removed the other teamates code and details about the assignment.

It utilizes automatic flake8 linting and unittest.
